I've been pondering in the back of my head about creating a blog for quite some time. Not like a classical blog , in a influencer sense, but more a blog about the technical challenges and "adventures" one gets when developing software.

After a bit of trial and error I've settled with this setup for now. This blog runs on jekyll and ruby, and is hosted for free through github.pages. 

Long term I hope to have multiple posts about various technical challenges I take on, in various programming languages and in different domains of usage. 

This includes a tag and category system for each blog post and aswell as detailed technical explanation for each project. 

At this time I'm also imagining to seperate the blog into three parts: 
- Codesnippets, hints or tips to certain subjects, ie. multithreading in general, or string formatting in c#.
- Projects I've done or am working on. 
- General programming concepts, design patterns such as creational, structural and behavioral. 
- Tools I use, anything from visual studio to unity, to eclipse to git.
